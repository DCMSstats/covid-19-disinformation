        =====================
        
        Getting Started
        ---------------
        
        Clone the repository
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          git clone https://github.com/DCMSstats/covid-19-disinformation.git
        
        You will need to install the python package in the repository. On a windows machine, open the Anaconda Prompt. On a OSX or Linux machine open the Terminal. Run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          pip install -e local_path/disinfo
        
        Replace `local_path` with the path to your package.
        
          If you are unsure of the local_path navigate to the folder and run pwd
        
        
        Environment
        -----------
        Setup a virtual environment.
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          python3 -m venv venv
        
        This sets up up the virtual environment, creating a venv folder.
        
        To activate the virtual environment run:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          source venv/bin/activate
        
          # To deactivate
          deactivate
        
        
        Once the virtual environment has been set up install the project dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`
        using:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        
        
        PRAW Authentication
        --------------------
        To access reddit you will need,
        
        1. Client ID & Client Secret:These two values are needed to access Reddit’s API as a script application.
        
        2. User Agent:	A user agent is a unique identifier that helps Reddit determine the source of network requests.
        
        You may choose to provide these by passing in three keyword arguments when calling the initializer of the Reddit class: client_id, client_secret, user_agent.
        
        .. code-block:: python
        
          import praw
        
          reddit = praw.Reddit(client_id="my client id",
                               client_secret="my client secret",
                               user_agent="my user agent")
        
        
        This method exposes the Authentication keys publicly as they are included in the GitHub code.
        
        Authentication can also be provided in an `praw.ini` configuration file. To run the code in this project you will need to provide this.
        
          It is recommended to use a `praw.ini` file in order to keep your authentication information separate from your code.
        
        You can obtain this by talking to a member of the team involved in this project.
        Alternatively you can provide your own authentication. To provide your own then look at the `reddit documentation <https://github.com/reddit-archive/reddit/wiki/API>`_.
        
        Once you have the `praw.ini` file then you need to place this file either:
        
        - In the current working directory
        - In the launching user’s config directory
        
        The second option is the preferred method but either will work. This will vary depending on what system you run, Windows, OSC or Linux. See `PRAW Documentation <https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started/configuration/prawini.html>`_ for guidance for your system.
        
        Pipeline
        ---------
        You can run this pipeline by running in a Terminal:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          python3 scrape_reddit.py
        
        The pipeline takes a number of arguments:
        
        -h, --help          show this help message and exit
        
        -t, --topics        Topics that praw will search reddit for. Required if
                           -config not used.
        
        -c, --comments      Selects number of comments for praw to limit to.
                            Required if -config not used.
        
        -config             Uses config.yaml file instead of providing options,
                            doesn't take any arguments but needs config.yaml file
                            (provided with package).
        
        -csv                Saves output to CSV, needs a directory to save csv to.
        
        -n, --name           Gives the file a name, if this option is not used in
                            conjunction with -csv then file will be called
                            reddit_database.
        
        -gbq, --bigquery   Saves results to google bigquery reddit_table. Needs
                          project id (found on google cloud platform),
                          reddit_table also needs name so flag -n must be used.
        
        -s, --sort          Tells pipeline to sort for comments based on
                            attribute. If this argument isn't used then the
                            default is new. Needs one of the following arguments:
                            controversial, gilded, hot, rising, top
        
        Examples of searchs are:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
          python3 scrape_reddit.py -t cats  -c 5
        
          python3 scrape_reddit.py -t cats -c 5 -csv /file_path -n my_csv
        
          python3 scrape_reddit.py -t cats -c 5 -gbq my_project_id -n my_gbq
        
          python3 scrape_reddit.py -t cats -c 5 -csv /file_path -n my_csv -s hot
        
        The pipeline needs either -t and -c or -config. If none is provided an error message will appear.
        
        -config uses a config.yaml file (provided in the package). To edit config file use`vim config.yaml` or open the `config.yaml` in your preferred text editor. If you are unsure about `YAML` then read this `quick guide <https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/>`_.
        
        -s is an optional argument. If -s is not used then the pipeline will sort comments by new.
        
        If the -gbq is used, a table called reddit_table will be created but needs a name using -n. If a name is not given error message will appear.
        
        
        When the pipeline is running it will print out the list of topics being searched for in reddit and the number of comments limited to and how comments are sorted.
